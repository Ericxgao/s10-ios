Taylr introduces you to one new classmate every day from UBC. It only takes a minute to peek into their life and if something catches your eye, just send a fun video message and say hi! 

Keep an opened-mind, you never know who you are gonna run into next! ;) Could be

- new friends who share your passions
- classmates to study with
- upperclass mentor to help advise you on your major
- a drummer for your band
- new member for your club
- and a million other things...

Never be too busy to meet someone new, because 10 years from now all you are gonna remember from school are the people you met and experience you shared.

Happy Taylring. ^_^
